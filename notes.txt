LOD generation for minecraft explanation.
(Dynamic Octree) LOD that wraps around a sphere (earth-like).
Otherwise, it is still obvious where the world stops.

Can't use texture arrays. Max size of array can only be 2048 = only 344 blocks possible.
Have to use texture atlasing.
For GUI however, we can just rebind the texture
Still not sure if entities get their own atlas or not.

Use a single VBO for each chunk.

Use cubic chunks (although limited height)

Crosshair has colour inversion in Minecraft.
Not sure how that works exactly.
Obviously you can do it in a fragment shader, reading from a framebuffer texture.

GUI scaling can be achieved by scaling all points not along the border by a single factor
